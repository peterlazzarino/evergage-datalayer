# react-evergage-AB

Integrate Evergage AB testing experiences into your react code.


## What it does

 - Listens for events dispatched by evergage experiences (must be added manually, format below)
 - Can mount muliple experiences per evergage campaign, experience will be decided by evergage and will be mounted after an event is fired in your evergage experience.
 - Will fall back to control group with option for manual override. Will wait for experience to be triggered by evergage before reverting to control group if the campaign is not active.
 - Will not mount a component until evergage gives an experience or the (customizeable) timeout expires after the window dom content loaded event to uphold anti-flicker-ness. 
 - Server Side Rendering friendly (will not mount on server side due to nature of campaigns)

## Installation

```
$ npm install --save react-evergage-ab
```

## Usage

Set up your campaign in evergage, for each experience (except for control) paste the following into the experience javascript for an invisible message.

Where campaign is the name of your campaign and variant is a descriptor for the experience you are editing.

```javascript  
var event = document.createEvent("CustomEvent");
event.initCustomEvent("EvergageAB-campaign", false, true, { variant: "variant"});
window.dispatchEvent(event);
```
The EvergageAB can be overriden in the component props. 

Then in your application use the EvergageAB component for your campaign, giving it an array of variants each with its experience descriptor and a component to render.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import EvergageAB from "react-evergage-ab";

class Header extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <EvergageAB campaign="logoTest" variants={[
                    {
                        name: "headingTest",
                        node: <h1>Test header</h1>
                    }, {
                        name: "spanHeading",
                        node: <span>Test header in span</span>
                    }, {
                        name: "boldHeading",
                        node: <span><b>Bold header in span</b></span>
                    }
                ]} />
            </div>
        )
    };
}
```
